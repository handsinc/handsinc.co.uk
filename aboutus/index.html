<h3 id="item1"><a name="community"></a>Our Work in the Community</h3>
<p>Hands Inc developed in 2001 in response to the need for massage and respite care within distressed families. Our family work grew to include those most in need, most prone to experience discrimination, social isolation, illness, disability and those with a multitude of problems that ultimately affects their physical, emotional and mental wellbeing. This group frequently experience inequalities in healthcare provision and poor health.<br /><br />We deliver our services in a variety of settings to help demystify them and increase access. Our main focus is to provide avenues for a healthy lifestyle, inspire wellbeing, raise self esteem, reduce anxiety, pain and stress.</p>

<p>In order to reach our target groups we work in partnership with groups and organisations that serve our client base. Our remit later extended to help support their employees and encourage employers to work towards best practice in establishing health and wellbeing at work. This gave rise to our Wellbeing@Work programme, which provides services to employers and their staff. We supported London Borough of Hackney in the development of their 'Healthy Workforce Strategy', for staff across the borough.<br /><br />Browse our Wellbeing@Work pages for information about services for your organisation.
