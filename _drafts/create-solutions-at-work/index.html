        <p><strong>Occupational Health (Art Therapy)</strong>
          <br />Stress and emotional difficulties are known to have a negative impact on an employee’s capacity in the workplace. Art Therapy is a valuable alternative to counselling for people who find it hard to put their feelings into words or find too many
          words stop them from getting to the heart of the matter.</p>
        <p><strong>Training Workshops for Professionals</strong>
          <br />Workshops introducing the use of basic therapeutic art skills and techniques for professionals to use with their clients or service users. This is not an art therapy training programme but gives professionals creative tools to engage with their
          clients or service users. This could be helpful for teachers, nursery workers, learning mentors, SENCOs, counsellors, mental health practitioners, social workers, occupational health workers and mediators among others.</p>
