<p><strong>You don’t have to have a creative bone in your body to do art therapy, as the emphasis is on the process of creating and expressing yourself rather than the product.</strong> Art materials such as paints, pastels, clay, and inks are used in an art therapy session as a tool for creating dialogue, interaction, self expression, emotional healing, reflection and self development among others. <br /><br />At Hands Inc we work with the art process in two different ways: Art Psychotherapy (sometimes called Art Therapy) and Exploratory Art. The needs of the group or individual referred, the expected outcomes and the setting will dictate how the programme is designed and developed. Art Psychotherapy and Exploratory Art are approaches inclusive of all regardless of gender, age, culture or creative ability. Our programmes can be tailored for groups or 1:1 sessions.</p>

<h3 id="item1"><a name="whatis"></a>1. What is Art Therapy?</h3>
<p><strong>Our Art Therapy programmes come in two categories and can be used in group settings or 1:1 sessions.</strong></p>
<p>The type chosen will depend on the depth of work wanting to be explored:</p>
<ul>
<li>Art Psychotherapy</li>
<li>Exploratory Art</li>

<p>Sometimes it is hard to grasp the difference between Art Psychotherapy (Art Therapy) and what we call Exploratory Art. Here is a simple analogy: Think of  snorkeling and diving. If you go snorkeling you can swim on the  water’s surface and glimpse at the fish below. Your equipment is simple,  just a snorkel and basic swimming ability.</p>
<p>However, when you go diving you can go much deeper into the water below, stay  down longer and explore greater sea life. But in order to dive deeply  you need a partner you can trust and professional equipment to be kept safe: an oxygen tank, wet suit and  flippers. Here, Exploratory Art is like snorkeling and Art  Psychotherapy is like diving, though ultimately it can be viewed as a  continuum.</p>

<h3 id="item3"><a name="typesprogs"></a>3. What type of programmes do you run?</h3>
<p><strong>Hands Inc has a track record of delivering innovative Art Psychotherapy and Exploratory Art programmes.</strong><br /><br />Our programmes can be used as stand alone or as part of a wrap around service to enhance the work you are doing with your clients, service users or staff. We have included some information about the types of programmes we specialise in below.<br /><br />Exhibitions are a feature of some of our programmes as a way to help raise the self esteem of the programme participant and to give a wider platform to their expressions and views.<br /><br /><strong>Drawn to Aspire: Bringing People Closer to work </strong><br />This art therapy programme provides a a safe and confidential space for clients to explore attitudes and experience of work, education and training through the  process of art making and reflection. It aims to develop emotional literacy and social skills to bring people closer to work.<br /><br /><strong>Drawing Journeys</strong><br />A programme for children or adults from black & ethnic minority groups, new arrivals, migrant communities, refugee and asylum, individuals or groups. The programme explores cultural and personal identity; community cohesion; transitions from country to country or across educational systems.

<p><strong>Therapeutic Art Games</strong><br />Children and young people come packed  with energy and unique ideas. Mention the words games and creativity  and they become a captive audience. Young people are encouraged to play  and invent art games that address issues of interest and concern.</p>
<p>The games are used to empower the young people in a fun and creative  way and can be themed to explore emotional issues. Games from this  programme have been developed into a book by <a href="http://www.vickyb.demon.co.uk/" target="_blank">Vicky Barber</a> called 'Creating Children's Art Games for Emotional Support'.</p>

<p><strong>Art Voices</strong><br />A platform for young peoples views on Crime & Community Cohesion.<br /><br />Art can play an important role within crime awareness and diversion by offering activities for young people that embrace reflection, creativity and dialogue around issues of personal choice and values. We can work with schools, youth organisations and services, the Police and Youth Offending Teams to engage with young people.<br /><br />The programme uses exploratory art as a tool to explore and express their views on crime, anti-social behaviour, personal aspirations and community cohesion. Art work generated from these programmes has been exhibited in a number of venues in London. Our Inner Art programme which launched this programme was exhibited at City Hall.</p>

<p>The exhibition was officially opened by James Cleverly the Mayor’s Youth Ambassador, who said of the programme:</p>
<p><span style="color: #0098eb;"><em style="font-family: Georgia,Times New Roman,Times,serif; font-size: 16px;">"Engaging   with young people as soon as they show signs of anti-social behaviour   is imperative. The exhibition gives real insight into the lives of the   youngsters, especially in terms of postcode rivalry, showing the pride   but also the fear and anxiety the youngsters have attached to their   postcodes. We need to work with young people on these issues to support   and guide them. Programmes like the Inner Art project helps build   self-esteem and raise aspiration"<br /><br /></em></span></p>

<h3 id="item4"><a name="creative"></a>4. Creative Solutions@Work</h3>
<p>There are many tried and tested ways of engaging with staff to affect change, to motivate and inspire. Using Exploratory Art workshops as an approach to organisational development is an innovative and creative way of engaging with your employees. The creative process can be a valuable medium for exploring change, identifying skills and strengths, team building, developing concepts and action plans.<br /><br /><strong>Office Away Days</strong><br />An office away day need never fill your staff with trepidation again! Sessions can be tailored to explore organisational issues or just give staff the opportunity to get to know each other and play together!<br /><br /><strong>Organisational Development & Team Building Workshops</strong><br />Looking for direction? Wanting to move your organisation forward but don’t know how? Are there skills your staff have that you are unaware of? We can help your organisation develop its strengths and move forwards.<br /><br /><strong>Product Development</strong><br />Looking for new ways to stimulate ideas or products? Want to get past a creative block? Exploratory Art workshops can help you or your team to develop a range of tools and techniques to release your creativity and stimulate ideas.<br /><br /><strong>Occupational Health (Art Therapy) </strong><br />Stress and emotional difficulties are known to have a negative impact on an employee’s capacity in the workplace. Art Therapy is a valuable alternative to counselling for people who find it hard to put their feelings into words or find too many words stop them from getting to the heart of the matter.<br /><br /><strong>Training Workshops for Professionals</strong><br />Workshops introducing the use of basic therapeutic art skills and techniques for professionals to use with their clients or service users. This is not an art therapy training programme but gives professionals creative tools to engage with their clients or service users. This could be helpful for  teachers, nursery workers, learning mentors, SENCOs, counsellors, mental health practitioners, social workers, occupational health workers and  mediators among others.</p>
