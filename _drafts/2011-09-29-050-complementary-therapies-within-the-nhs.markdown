<h3 id="item1">Why Complementary Therapy?</h3>
<p>Complementary therapies provide people with additional means in which to cope with anxiety, stress, and pain and help people help themselves to live more healthy lifestyles. <em>(B.Berman Integrative Approaches to Pain Management: How to get the best from both worlds, British Medical Journal Vol326 14.6.03)</em> <br /><br />The Department of Health acknowledges that there are now numerous complementary therapies available in the UK. Some of these therapies have been known to help alleviate the symptoms of certain illnesses in cases where orthodox medicine does not seem to have offered a complete solution. <br /><br />It's now common for hospital clinics to offer some form of complementary therapy. Acupuncture, for example, has long been used in pain clinics, aromatherapy and massage are commonly used in cancer, and osteopathy and chiropractic are recognised by conventional medical colleges as being beneficial treatments for back pain.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3 id="item2">Facts and Stats</h3>
<p>Peter Littlejohn, NICE Clinical & Public Health Director, said that the beneficial effect of the complementary therapies on lower back pain  was “sufficiently robust” to recommend them over less cost-effective procedures such as X-rays or injections into the spine. <em>“As with many interventions the underlying process of how acupuncture works is still not completely clear, but I think the evidence still shows that on balance patients do better,”</em> 2009 <br /><br />An April 2001 survey by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) found that one person in ten in the United Kingdom (UK) had used a complementary therapy in the previous 12 months. <br /><br />A recent survey of GPs by Sheffield University found that 49 per cent of practices offered access to some form of complementary medicine in 2001, compared with 39 per cent in 1995. Almost a third of practices now provide some form of complementary medicine in-house.<br /><br />Hackney ranks as the second highest  London Borough where 15.96% of the working aged population are living with long term illness ('Hackney Key Facts', Research and Statistic Team Nov 2004) <br /><br />A key health floor target put forward by the Hackney Strategic Planning Team is to substantially reduce the mortality rate from heart disease, stroke and cancer by 2010, as well as reducing health inequalities by 10%.<br /><br />Back pain is one of the most common ailments confronting GPs, affecting 80% of the population in the UK and costing the nation £6 million a year in lost working days and healthcare.  <br /><br /></p>

<h3 id="item4">Benefits of a complementary service within your practice:</h3>
<p>Many primary care professionals have become interested in complementary medicine because of the gap between what they can do for patients and what orthodox medicine enables them to do.</p>
<p>Healthcare professionals are facing increased demands often greater than the service they can provide. <strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Our services can help you to:</strong></p>
<ul>
