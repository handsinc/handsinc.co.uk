### Complementing Your Health

Are you over 50, want to improve your health, meet new friends and get out and about? Then come along to our friendly fortnightly Complementing Your Health Project.

We provide:
* Massage Sessions
* Gentle Exercise 
* Wellbeing Talks 

If you have any mobility issues we may be able to offer transport to help you get to the sessions.

### Pass It On

Would you like the opportunity to gain new skills and support others? 
As part of our programme we are offering Hackney residents who are 50plus the opportunity to  learn a basic chair based yoga exercise routine that they can then take out into the community and teach others. We will offer free monthly training sessions to support you, no previous skills needed.
