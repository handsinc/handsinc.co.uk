* **[Support Group]({{ site.baseurl }}/services/menopause-project/support-group):** Fortnightly Support Group run every Thursday in Hackney where you can come along, socialise with other women and get support.
* **Workshops:** We run workshops to help increase knowledge and aid symptom management. The workshops are run by expert facilitators and look at all aspects of the Menopause including: stress, anxiety, sleep, hot flushes and how to manage them with expert facilitators. 
* **Talks, Consultation & Menopause Awareness Presentations for Employers & Professionals:**
To enhance the support we offer women, we also work to help influence change in services and work environments that menopausal women may use. This has included working with GP’s, City & Hackney CCG, Homerton University Hospital, Public Health England’s Post Reproductive Team and LB Hackney. This has helped to improve clinical pathways, establish Menopause at Work policies and menopause awareness training for a range of professionals and employers. 

"We found the training very relevant and engaging and feel more confident supporting menopausal women." -
Psychology Team at St Leonard's Hospital
