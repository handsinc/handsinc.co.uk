When you mention the word menopause all too often women’s eyes glaze over either because they are finding the symptoms debilitating, or they feel embarrassed, or think its got nothing to do with them!

Well ladies its a subject that we should all pay attention to as 85% of women struggle with menopause symptoms and most don’t know how to manage the transition that all women will eventually face.

Why not come along to our friendly women’s support group to learn more about the Menopause, share your experiences and get support.
