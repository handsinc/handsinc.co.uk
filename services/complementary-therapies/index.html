<p><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/stories/comptherapypic1.jpg" border="0" style="border: 0pt none; float: left; margin-right: 15px;" />A table massage which uses oil and encourages the body to completely relax. Clothing will need to be removed in order to receive this treatment. Treatments can be tailored to specific conditions. Deep Tissue Massage focuses on the deeper layers of muscles. It helps to loosen muscle tissues, and the build up of tension. It is very often used to relieve chronic muscle and soft tissue pain or injury. Positive results:</p>
<p>• Releases toxins &amp; deep seated tension<br />• Improves flexibility and relieves pain<br />• Stimulates the circulatory and lymphatic systems</p>
<p> </p>

A great way of introducing massage to the novice and is very popular as a stress buster in the work environment for staff. Why not consider it as a way of attracting attention to your organisation at promotional events?</p>
<p>Positive results:</p>
<p>• Leaves the body feeling uplifted and refreshed<br />• Relieves stress and tension, eye strain and headache</p>
<p> </p>

<p><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/stories/comptherapypic4.jpg" border="0" width="160" height="180" style="float: left; margin-right: 15px; border: 0pt none;" />A specific form of head and upper body massage where no clothing is removed.

<p>• Relief of chronic neck &amp; shoulder stiffness<br />• Loosens the scalp <br />• Helps tension headaches, eye strain, ear and jaw aches, sinusitis/congestion</p>

Clothing will need to be removed.</p>
<h3 id="item5">Reflexology</h3>
<p><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/stories/reflexologysmall.jpg" border="0" alt="reflexology" title="reflexology" width="160" height="180" style="float: left; margin-right: 15px; border: 0pt none;" />This treatment works on the basis that the hands and feet acts as a map to the whole body. By manipulating and applying pressure to the different areas of the feet or hands, the whole body is stimulated and rejuvenated.</p>
<h3 id="item6">Shiatsu</h3>
<p><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/stories/comptherapypic6.jpg" border="0" width="160" height="180" style="float: left; margin-right: 15px; border: 0pt none;" />A clothed massage with roots in traditional Chinese medicine. Shiatsu works by stimulating and manipulating different pressure points around the body to relieve pain and energy blocks. The therapist works on the floor with a futon.</p>
<h3 id="item7">Reiki</h3>
<p><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/stories/comptherapypic7.jpg" border="0" width="160" height="180" style="float: left; margin-right: 15px; border: 0pt none;" />This treatment works with the body’s subtle energies to give a gentle healing treatment, and works with the light laying on of hands. No clothing is removed, this is a relaxing and non invasive treatment.</p>
<h3 id="item8">Acupuncture</h3>
<p><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/stories/comptherapypic8.jpg" border="0" width="160" height="140" style="float: left; margin-right: 15px; border: 0pt none;" /></p>
<p>Acupuncture forms part of a 2,000 year old Traditional Chinese Medical system which aims at promoting well being.<br />During the  initial consultation the practitioner takes your medical history including your main presenting your condition, discusses relevant aspects of your lifestyle and  examines your pulse, tongue and abdomen. In treatments,  single-use fine sterile disposable needles are inserted into specifically chosen acu-points along the energy channels known as meridians. <br />By regulating the  ‘qi’ or vital energy of the acu points and meridians acupuncture can help re-establish the free flow of qi to restore balance and trigger the body's natural healing response.  Acupuncture can promote feelings of well being and help you feel more positive, relaxed and revitalised.<br />Acupuncture is  recognised as being clinically effective for conditions such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Non specific low back pain</li>
<li>Osteo-arthritis of the knee</li>
<li>Nausea</li>
<li>Vomiting</li>
<li>Dental pain. </li>
</ul>
