    <h1>Closure of Hands Inc charity</h1>
    <p>It is with regret that Hands Inc has closed. </p>
  
    <p>As the current trustees, we want to pay tribute to the amazing hard work of all our staff, volunteers and former trustees over the last twenty years. We’ve done amazing work and provided much-valued help to hundreds of local residents. In particular, we made a name for ourselves for bringing complementary health approaches to people that would not otherwise have had access to these, and for our innovative menopause work. In particular we would like to credit the many years of dedication given by our founder Eileen Bellott and our long-term IT volunteer Tristan Hill.</p>  
  
    <p>We have also enjoyed productive relationships with colleagues working in local NHS organisations and Hackney Council, and we would like to extend our thanks to all those partners that provided funding and advice, brokered partnerships and enabled our work in many ways. We’d also like to thank Jake Ferguson and all the current and former staff at <a href="http://www.hcvs.org.uk/">Hackney Council for Voluntary Service</a> that have supported and advised us over the years. </p>
  
    <p>Despite our best efforts, and despite the excellence of the work, we could not raise the funding needed to continue our work. All of our current projects exceeded their expectations and targets, yet the funding environment is extremely competitive, and grant funders and public sector commissioners were simply unable to meet increasing demands for funding. </p>
  
    <p>Our closure was not at all related to the outbreak of Covid-19.</p>
  
    <p>Whilst it is sad that we had to close, we continue to celebrate the wonderful work Hands Inc did over two decades. Our volunteers and contractors will no doubt take the experiences gained at Hands Inc forward in their careers, and we wish you all the very best.</p>
