<p><strong>Volunteer and Work placement Opportunities at Hands Inc</strong></p>
<p>Volunteering gives people the opportunity to build skills, gain confidence or make a valuable contribution to the community. At Hands Inc we feel this should be a two way exchange, you give something and we give something.</p>
<p>We offer work placement and volunteering opportunities to therapists and facilitators who are either completing training or have experience in the area of complementary therapies or art therapy. Hands Inc offers volunteer therapists rewarding  professional development and supervision. <a href="{{ site.base_url }}/contact-us/" title="contact us">Contact us for an application pack.</a></p>
<p>We have been working with Hertfordshire University since 2009 offering placement opportunities to their MA  Art Therapy students. Our Low Cost Complementary Therapy clinics offer work placement opportunities to students at Westminster University.</p>
<p>If you represent  an educational organisation and want to discuss placement opportunities for your students, or if you are looking to secure a placement for yourself please <a href="mailto:handsinc@handsinc.co.uk" title="contact us">contact us</a>. Where already qualified, volunteers will need to provide evidence of professional qualifications, membership certificate to a governing body, and professional insurance. If currently training, student insurance will be needed.</p>
